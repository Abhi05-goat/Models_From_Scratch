# Linear_Regression_From_Scratch
Title: Linear Regression from Scratch in Python

Description:
This repository contains an implementation of simple linear regression from scratch in Python without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. The project demonstrates:

Data visualization
Loss function (Mean Squared Error)
Gradient Descent optimization
Parameter updates over multiple epochs
The dataset used is Salary_dataset.csv, which contains YearsExperience as the independent variable and Salary as the dependent variable.

Key Features:
âœ… No external ML libraries used
âœ… Custom implementation of gradient descent
âœ… Cost function visualization

ðŸ”¹ Usage:

Load Salary_dataset.csv (Ensure it's in the correct directory)
